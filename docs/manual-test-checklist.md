# Manual hardware test checklist

Use a disposable Codex chat with no unsaved prompt text. Check off each item only after observing the result in the live app.

## Profile switching and display

- [ ] Click the Codex window: the CT switches to `Codex Controller`.
- [ ] Click a different application: the CT leaves the Codex profile and follows that application/System.
- [ ] Re-focus Codex: the last Codex workspace returns without a service restart.
- [ ] All touchscreen labels are readable at normal viewing distance and none are visibly clipped.
- [ ] Workspace colors are distinct: blue Commands, cyan Agents, purple Skills, green Quick Text.
- [ ] The center wheel clearly shows Lightbulb / BrainCircuit / Zap for Plan / Reasoning / Fast.
- [ ] The five custom dial displays clearly show Bot / ScrollText / Type / BrainCircuit / PanelsTopLeft; System Volume still shows Loupedeck's native icon.

- [ ] Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts shows Reasoning Up as `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Up`.
- [ ] Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts shows Cycle Reasoning as `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R`.
- [ ] Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts shows Toggle Plan Mode as `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P`.
- [ ] Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts shows Toggle Fast Mode as `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F`.

## Square and fixed buttons

- [ ] A/B/C/D send Up/Left/Down/Right.
- [ ] FN+A/B/C/D send Page Up/Home/Page Down/End.
- [ ] E opens the Command Menu.
- [ ] Fixed Home retains its normal Loupedeck behavior.
- [ ] Fixed Enter/Esc retains its normal Loupedeck behavior.
- [ ] Fixed Keyboard retains its normal Loupedeck behavior.
- [ ] FN works both alone and with A–D as expected.

Record any failed item with the active workspace, exact control, visible Codex state, and whether a second attempt behaved differently. Direct-shortcut failures are most likely caused by a stale Codex session, focus, or a shortcut conflict.
